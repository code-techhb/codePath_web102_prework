## Notes

### Challenges Encountered During Development

1. **Filtering and Searching:** Implementing the search functionality required careful handling of string comparisons to ensure the search was case-insensitive and user-friendly.
2. **Dynamic Content Updates:** Ensuring that the game list updated dynamically when user clicked on the buttons without performance issues or stale data in the DOM was a challenge.
3. **Event Handling:** Managing event listeners for the search bar and filter buttons was crucial to avoid conflicts and ensure smooth functionality.
